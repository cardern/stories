As the tree hit her from behind
she didn't have time to react
she folded forwards, forced by impact
Her life didn't flash before her eyes
Her arm felt heavy and weightless
she remembered the things she still wanted to do 
but hadn't made time for yet
Whether or not it had been enough became irrelevant 
under the weight of what was

Form should never come at the expense of function. The two can coexist, but everything needs to have a purpose. You can intentionally keep a feature set limited, but the primary reason to do this would be to maintain focus on the core capability of the product, not to ensure that the product is beautiful.

"Basically, everything out there is binary in some way or another: dead or alive, blue or green, good or evil, one or many. Of course there can be a spectrum for any given binary pair, but ultimately every single thing falls into one camp or the other. Something could be on the verge of death, or comatose, but until they actually cross the plane they are still considered alive. Someone might commit an act that could be categorized as evil, but when it comes to labelling the person themselves it is a weighing of all their actions and the effects that they have. Some weight is given to intentions, but if there is an outsized evil impact sprung from good intentions then the person is finally categorized as evil. Do you follow me?" 
"Well yes, although I don't necessarily agree with your examples. Blue or green? There are lots of other colors!"
"You could say the same thing about life or death, but it all comes down to definitions of terms. For example, would you consider a mushroom dead or alive? Under certain definitions of life, it would qualify, but under others it wouldn't. So your worldview is formed by the definitions that you acknowledge."
"I can agree with that, but still... blue or green? What about a fire truck?"
"Green."
"How do you figure that?"
"Well, it's not blue, so by my calculation that makes it green."
"Why wouldn't the binary pair then just be blue and not blue?"
"You can't just go around life creating your binary pairs based on negation. Something can't be defined by absence, it needs to be given identity."

Cats are not trusted
They are aliens with stockholm syndrome
Untrainable and unknowable

He was in the habit of smoking a cigarette after getting home from work
He had quit in the past and still considered himself clean
It was always just one, highly regimented but still something to look forward to
An almost military like habit in its limitation and continuity
He found himself looking at the clock near the end of the day quite often
His discipline in this practice was almost a source of pride

The first and last bites are the best
Followed by the second and all in between
If you drop the ice cream cone, did you still enjoy it?

8-27-18
A snail outgrowing its shell
But too slow to change, and now stuck
Sluggy mass pressing out on carapace, threatening to rupture
We all have moments like this

8-26-18 
Spoon to broth, gingerly testing
Immediate flavor, back of jaw richness
Eat slowly so as not to oversaturate
In sharing, it's revealed - "Too much fil√©"
Enjoyment still present but dampened

8-25-18 
Leaves rustling outside. 
Light shined - nothing revealed. 
Nervousness about the night and its terrors. 
The cat at the window, searching with you and finding nothing.
Suddenly, a bright naked tail, illuminated by moon and kitchen lights.
Invasion by a possum hoping to exist.
